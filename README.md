# speach_balloon-sliding_images_preview-external_file_render

One of the amazing interactivity course that we made.
It has:
- speach ballon and a semi-chat
- sliding imagers that gets bigger when selecting
- calling an external file and use it to render a page

**NOTE**
All images are in the zip file so that git will consider it as one file.
